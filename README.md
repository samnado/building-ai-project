# Building AI Project

## Summary
This project demonstrates a simple AI-based classification concept.

## Background
Artificial intelligence can be used to classify objects based on measurable features.
This project was created as part of the Building AI course.

## How is it used?
The model takes inputs and produces a classification result.
It can be used for educational and demonstration purposes.

## Data sources and AI methods
- Data: example or hypothetical dataset
- Method: supervised machine learning classification

## Challenges
- Small dataset
- Possible bias
- Limited generalization

## What next?
Future improvements could include larger datasets and better models.

## Acknowledgments
Created as part of the Building AI course by the University of Helsinki.
